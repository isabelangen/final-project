Drawing on the Web Final Project

I am very inspired by the “Simple Net Art Diagram.” This semester I am also writing my Theatre Studies thesis on Performance Art, which, like Net Art, exists as an ephemeral event rather than a document or artifact. 

The red lightning bolt featured in the diagram will be a through-line image in the three art pages. The lightning bolt significantly does not only locate the art, but its shape gives us an impression of the non-static, transitory nature of Net (and Performance) Art. 

I envision one of the pages using HTML Canvas and having a trace of lightning bolts follow the mouse cursor over the browser window, actively creating a new drawing as the user moves the cursor: a visible and live documentation of the ephemeral location of the art. 

In another page, I will use CSS Animation to seemingly move the lightning bolt around the page, sometimes out of view, sometimes in motion, on a predetermined path. The moments of invisibility will be especially important: if for Net (and Performance) Art, the art “happens” in an invisible and conceptual way, will we still recognize the piece as a work of art in moments where the visible artifact (the lightning bolt) of that ephemeral art is out of sight?

In my third page, I will use the image of the “Simple Net Art Diagram” itself, and have several clickable lightning bolts which, on click, will change the page in some way. I have not yet decided what change I want them to make, but my ideas include triggering a sound, triggering change either the colors of lightning bolts or the background, or perhaps revealing hidden images (other lightning bolts, or perhaps images of famous works of visual art). 

The blue underlined text of “The art happens here” on the diagram already resembles the generic link styling for text, so I will build on that idea for my navigational interface, having links that say something along the lines of “The art happens here,” “And here,” “And here” in the same blue underlined styling as the Simple Net Art Diagram.
